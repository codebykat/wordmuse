** This is a work in progress! **

wordmuse is a Django-based flashcard application that I wrote to support
my study of Japanese.  It syncs data from a spreadsheet on Google Docs.

To get started:

Edit settings.py for important things such as the database setup.

Then (this is basic Django fare):

$ createdb wordmuse      # create the database
$ ./manage.py syncdb     # initialize the database
$ ./manage.py runserver  # run the app locally

Should work fine with your own CSV file (see the provided words.csv for
an example); as of right now if you want to pull from a Google Docs
spreadsheet you'll need to change the code in views.py.  (I'll pull
that out into settings someday.)
